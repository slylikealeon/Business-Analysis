<h1> Business Analyst - Test </h1>
In Customer Support world, the number of support request (or “tickets”) received is crucial information as it is an image of the volume of work needed to solve them, and therefore of the
number of agents needed. Another measure of importance is TPR, or “Tickets Per Ride”. It allows us to determine the “health” of a market.
In order to complete this task, we provide you with two .csv files:
- one containing information about tickets of a specific market during a certain period of
time,
- the second with information about orders for the same market during the same period.
The task is formed of two parts:

1. Forecast the daily number of agents that will be needed to work on that market to cover
the expected volume of tickets for a minimum of 31 days.

2. First, provide a formal definition for “TPR”. Then analyse market health, provide insights and conclusions. Explain these insights and conclusions both as you would present to
another technical analyst, and to a stakeholder not familiar with the technicalities.
Emphasis should be set on explaining and discussing in detail the processes followed, method used and assumptions made in completing the task.
You should also point out any limitations and edge cases, as well as state what additional information (if any) you think were missing from the original problem statement and that would
have allowed you to provide more accurate results
